## Nimi
Niri's IPC, wrapped for the Nim language.

### Why?
We have an IPC interface for Sway and Hyprland, just
wanted to make sure Niri wasn't missing out. :)


Anyways, I originally wanted to learn Nim for EWW
widgeting, and I really enjoyed it, while I didn't get
anything working during the time I was making the interface, I
decided to refactor the project into an IPC wrapper for Niri in
general.
